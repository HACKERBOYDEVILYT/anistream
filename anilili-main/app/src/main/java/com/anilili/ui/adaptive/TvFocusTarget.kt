/**
 * A [FocusRequester] that also reports whether anything is currently holding it.
 *
 * The D-pad screens redirect focus across composables that do not share a parent — the top nav
 * hands Down to the home rows, Right to the search box. Those redirects are expressed as
 * `focusProperties { down = requester }`, and Compose resolves them by calling
 * [FocusRequester.requestFocus] from inside `FocusOwnerImpl` while the key event is being
 * dispatched. When no node holds the requester that call throws `IllegalStateException:
 * FocusRequester is not initialized`, and because the throw happens inside the focus owner rather
 * than at our redirect site there is nothing to wrap in `runCatching` — it kills the process.
 *
 * The target screens are only composed on some routes and only after their data loads, so the
 * redirect has to disappear whenever its destination is absent. [isAttached] is what the redirect
 * sites read to decide that; it is plain snapshot state, so reading it during composition rebuilds
 * the modifier chain when a destination appears or goes away.
